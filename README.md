<h1>MSc Thesis</h1>

<section>
	<p align="justify">I have been working mostly on Bayesian Statistical Method for my Masters' research. In particular, we have have developed a nice way of doing Bayesian Model Comparison using Savage-Dickey Density Ratio (SDDR). Refer to the section below for further details. Moreover, as the second part of the thesis, the aim is to predict the likely distance between two point sources which are on top of each other, but buried in noise.</a></p>

## Bayesian Inference and Bayesian Model Selection

<p align="justify"> While in Bayesian Parameter Estimation, the marginal likelihood is irrelevant (as it is independent of the model parameters), it is crucial in Bayesian Model Selection. For example, using Bayes' Theorem again, <a></p>

<p align="justify"> Therefore, if we have two competing models, <a></p>

<p align="justify"> Calculating the Bayesian Evidence is hard (but can be done analytically for Gaussian Linear Models). However, if one model is nested in the other model, one can use the Savage-Dickey Density Ratio to calculate the Bayes Factor. <a></p>
